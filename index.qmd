This website began as a class assignment, but I decided to turn it into my personal site. It serves as a space for me to share a bit about myself and showcase some of my projects. I've also kept one of the older posts from my class because I thought it was neat.

Right now, the website is a bit sparse since I'm just getting started. I'm still figuring out the best way to manage this page. Currently, I'm considering turning it into a small blog to document my project progress. I might also share my journey with LeetCode here.
