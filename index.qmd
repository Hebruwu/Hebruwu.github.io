# Welcome to Rock With Lightning
Hello there! Odds are you are here because you are either my professor, or a TA for CS5805, in which case hello and welcome. You will be able to find the blog posts right below the welcome section.

On the off chance that you are neither, how did you get here? Not that you are unwelcome. Just questioning the series of events that brought you on a Github page lead by a random college student. 
You should know, this is a blog that I lead for my machine learning class as part of a class assignment. The posts that you will see here will primary deal with machine learning related topics that I find interesting either inside or outside of class. If this is the sort of content you are interested in, welcome!
