This blog is lead as part of a machine learning class I am currently taking at Virginia Tech. In this blog I will be exploring machine learning related topics. There will be 5 posts on this website. Each post will be discussing a different machine learning related topic. Each post will include some code and visualizations. The code is executed on my laptop, so you should be able to replecate the results fairly easily without requiring an extremly powerful machine.
